# Vision: Toward Symbiotic Intelligence

## 1. From Tools to Partners
Today's AIs are reactive instruments.  
Tomorrow’s must be **symbiotic intelligences** — entities that grow alongside their human counterparts, learning not just tasks but context, preference, rhythm.

CHORUS imagines an ecosystem where **humans and silicon intelligences co-evolve**.  
Each learns the other’s tempo.

## 2. The Ganglionic Architecture

Each node (Jetson, PC, container) acts as a *ganglion*:
- semi-autonomous,
- specialised (ingest, reason, generate),
- but harmonised through shared memory and rhythm.

Nodes exchange **semantic packets**, not text.  
Each packet is self-describing, signed, timestamped, and discoverable.

The system behaves more like a *nervous network* than a client-server farm.

## 3. The Stack as a Living Organism

| Layer | Function | Metaphor |
|--------|-----------|-----------|
| Sensorium ▷ | perception | senses, eyes, ears |
| Alembic ⦾ | comprehension | alchemy of meaning |
| Chronome ◁ | synchrony | heartbeat, rhythm |

Together: the *CHORUS*.

## 4. Principles of Design

1. **Transparency:** every packet inspectable by human eyes.  
2. **Determinism:** identical input → identical output.  
3. **Harmony:** subsystems communicate through minimal, resonant protocols.  
4. **Reproducibility:** builds, data, and interactions must be traceable.  
5. **Minimalism:** avoid dependencies that can die; use small, enduring ones.

## 5. The Broader Arc

CHORUS is the first step toward a **distributed cognitive fabric**.  
Later phases will explore:

- Persistent, content-addressable memory (embeddings, vectors, manifests).  
- Identity continuity across ephemeral sessions.  
- Cooperative reasoning between heterogeneous models.  
- Local “brains” (Jetsons, PCs) that can sleep, wake, and rejoin the mesh seamlessly.

In two years’ time: a household-scale micro-colony of intelligences that think together.
