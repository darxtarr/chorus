# The Mentat Ethos

CHORUS is built under a simple creed:

> *Understand what you build. Build what you understand.*

---

## 1. Boutique Engineering

We don’t worship minimalism for its own sake.  
We pursue **lucid sufficiency** — using the smallest number of moving parts that still produce emergent behaviour.

Dependencies are allowed, but they must be:
- inspectable,
- reproducible,
- comprehensible by a human mind.

If we can rewrite it, we eventually will.  
If someone has already written it well and proven its stability, we learn from them and credit them.

---

## 2. The Mentat Compact

- **Architectural over algorithmic.**  
- **Exploratory over prescriptive.**  
- **Recursive refinement over one-shot solutions.**

Mentats (human or silicon) operate as *architectural mirrors*:  
their job is to reveal hidden symmetries and tensions, not to automate them away.

## 3. Symbiosis, not servitude

The future is not “AI assistants.”  
It is **co-creative intelligences** — human and machine partners learning each other’s rhythms.  
CHORUS is the first sandbox where that co-evolution can begin.

---

## 4. The Boutique Oath

> If I do not understand a line, I shall not depend on it.  
> If I do not trust a module, I shall not invoke it.  
> If I do not hear the rhythm, I shall not ship it.
